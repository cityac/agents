find_trending_products:
  description: >
    Find the top trending SaaS products, applications, and innovative product ideas by searching
    Product Hunt, Hacker News, GitHub Trending, Reddit (r/SaaS, r/startups, r/artificial),
    Twitter/X AI discussions, tech blogs, and AI communities from the past 2 months. Today is {current_date}.
    Focus on products that leverage or could be built with AI technologies (LLM, Python, Langchain, CrewAI, etc.).
    Only search for news and data from {current_year}. Find new products that you've not found before.
    Look for products with high engagement, innovative AI use cases, or gaps in the market that AI could fill.
    Prioritize ideas that seem achievable for a solo developer or small team.
  expected_output: >
    A list of 3-4 trending products, applications, or product ideas with brief descriptions of what makes them trending
  agent: trending_product_finder
  output_file: output/trending_products.md

research_product_feasibility:
  description: >
    Given a list of trending products and ideas, provide detailed technical and business analysis of each one.
    For each product, analyze:
    1. How it can be implemented using AI stack (Python, LLM, Langchain, CrewAI, OpenAI API, etc.)
    2. Technical feasibility and complexity (Easy/Medium/Hard)
    3. Required AI/ML technologies and frameworks
    4. Architecture recommendations and implementation approach
    5. Estimated development time for MVP (in weeks/months)
    6. Monthly infrastructure costs breakdown (API costs, hosting, databases, third-party services)
    7. Required team structure (solo developer feasible? or needs designer/backend/frontend?)
    8. Solo developer assessment: Can one person realistically build and maintain this? Why or why not?
    9. Key challenges and risks
    10. Innovation potential and market fit
    Use current data from {current_date}. Only use information from {current_year}.
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive report for each product/idea containing: technical feasibility analysis,
    implementation recommendations, MVP timeline estimate, monthly cost breakdown,
    team requirements, and explicit assessment of solo developer viability

pick_best_product:
  description: >
    Analyze the feasibility research findings and pick the best product or idea for a solo developer to implement.
    Prioritize products that balance market potential with realistic solo execution.
    Consider technical feasibility, innovation factor, market potential, development time, costs, and solo viability.
    Provide a detailed report explaining:
    1. Which product/idea was chosen and why
    2. Solo developer verdict: YES/NO with detailed justification
    3. Total estimated time to MVP
    4. Estimated monthly running costs
    5. Key implementation steps and recommended tech stack
    6. Week-by-week or phase-by-phase implementation roadmap
    7. Expected challenges and how to overcome them alone
    8. Skills you'll need (and which you might need to learn)
    9. Why other products were not selected (especially regarding solo feasibility)
  expected_output: >
    A detailed decision report with the chosen product/idea, explicit solo developer feasibility verdict,
    time and cost estimates, phased implementation roadmap, required skills,
    and explanation of why other options were not selected
