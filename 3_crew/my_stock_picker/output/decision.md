**Chosen Company for Investment: Linker Vision**

**Rationale**: Linker Vision is selected as the optimal company for investment due to its strategic focus on AI-powered solutions for smart city infrastructure. The company's recent $35 million Series A funding, led by Abico Group and participation from NVIDIA, demonstrates strong financial backing and credibility. Furthermore, its cutting-edge innovations in AI platform development for city management, traffic optimization, and public safety are aligned with growing global trends towards smart city solutions. The strategic partnership with NVIDIA enhances their capabilities and market position, indicating promising long-term growth potential.

**Companies Not Selected**:

**HeyMax**
- While HeyMax presents a promising opportunity in the growing travel and loyalty rewards market, its focus remains regional with expansion plans limited to Japan, Taiwan, and Australia.
- The company, although innovative in integrating AI for loyalty experiences, lacks the broader global infrastructure impact and high-growth partnerships that Linker Vision possesses. The investment in HeyMax seems more regionally focused with lower scalability in comparison to Linker Vision's global smart city ambitions.
- Given the current market dynamics and investment focus on scalable technology solutions, HeyMax was not chosen as it doesn't match the broader innovation scope offered by Linker Vision.
